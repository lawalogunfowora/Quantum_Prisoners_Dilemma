# Quantum_Prisoners_Dilemma
Runs a Quantum Version of the Prisoners' Dilemma Game on Qiskit.

* An introduction to a classical version of Quantum Prisoners Dilemma: [Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kLb1glm6EM)
* The implementation is based on this [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/quant-ph/9806088.pdf) by *Eisert J. etal* on Quantum Game and Quantum Strategies.

The **qpd.py** python script accepts the players' strategies, degree of entanglements and number of rounds on the command line as argument.

The **qpd_interface.py** script launches a GUI for the game built on TKinter in Python.
